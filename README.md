# Enigma

Enigma involves building a simulator for a generalized version of the Enigma machines that Germany used during World War II to encrypt its military communications. The Enigmas effect a substitution cipher on the letters of a message. That is, at any given time, the machine performs a permutation—a one-to-one mapping—of the alphabet onto itself.
